# Part-IIB-Dissertation-Code
This is the code associated with the Part IIB Dissertation submitted in March 2023, associated with candidate number 8856. 

# Content of Main Folder
This contains a sample of the **Grammatical Error Detection** probing results for Layer 12 of BERT (Devlin et al 2019). All probing experiments cited were run in the Computer Lab in research supported by Cambridge University Press & Assessment.  The per-layer probing results were personally shared by Chris Davis and Andrew Caines for further analysis in this dissertation. 

# Marvin & Linzen Stimuli
The targeted syntactic evaluation dataset developed by **Marvin & Linzen** is included in the folder. 

#Causal Mediation Analysis
The code for **causal mediation analysis** experiment developed by Finlayson et al (2021) is included. It was not replicated as this causal mediation analysis is very computationally expensive– the authors note that it “can  take hours on a GPU. The outputs also require gigabytes of space for the largest models.”

#Multimodal CLIP Experiments Code
A selection of the code from Salhan, Liu & Collier (2022/forthcoming) for intrinsic semantic evaluation of multimodal CLIP is also included.
