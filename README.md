# Part-IIB-Dissertation-Code
This is the code associated with the Part IIB Dissertation submitted in March 2023, associated with candidate number 8856. 

The code for causal mediation analysis experiment is available open-source:  \url{https://github.com/mattf1n/lm-intervention}.  It was not replicated as this causal mediation analysis is very computationally expensive– \citeauthor{finlayson-etal-2021-causal} note that it “can  take hours on a GPU. The outputs also require gigabytes of space for the largest models.”

 
 The Grammatical Error Detection probe is (as of 06/03/23) now available open-source: \url{https://github.com/chrisdavis90/ged-syntax-probing}. The per-layer probing results were personally shared by Chris Davis and Andrew Caines for further analysis in the dissertation. All probing experiments cited were run in the Computer Lab in research supported by Cambridge University Press \& Assessment.
